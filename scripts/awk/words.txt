AWK is a language for processing text files. 
A file is treated as a sequence of records, and by default each line is a record. 
Each line is broken up into a sequence of fields, so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field, the second word as the second field, and so on.
An AWK program is of a sequence of pattern-action statements. 
AWK reads the input a line at a time. 
A line is scanned for each pattern in the program, and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed.
